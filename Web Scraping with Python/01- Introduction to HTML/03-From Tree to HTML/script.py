From Tree to HTML

Here you are given the chance to create your own bit of HTML code (as a python string). More specifically, below is an HTML tree image and you will finish the missing code within the string html which produces this HTML tree.

To note:

We have started the string html for you, to help nudge you in the correct direction.
The spacing we use in the portion of the string we provide (e.g., indenting <head> two spaces more than <html>) isn't necessary, but we did so just to make it easier to read.

Instructions
100 XP
Fill in the blank within the string variable html so that the HTML code matches its tree representation (including the text within the two paragraph children).
